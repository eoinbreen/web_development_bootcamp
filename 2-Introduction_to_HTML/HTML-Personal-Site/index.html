        <p><em>Temporary Clerical Officer in the <strong>Department of Social Protection</strong></em></p>
        <p> I am currently part of the Temporary Protection Ukraine(TPU) Unit. My job is to make decisions on
            Jobseekers Allowance(JA) claims for the Ukrainian refugees currently entering our country. I am given
            several tasks every day, each task is linked to a customer and I need to decide whether they are
            eligible for JA</p>
